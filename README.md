# Chatbot-With-Role-Based-PDF-Management
This project is a RAG-based intelligent chatbot system that enables authenticated users (Admins) to upload custom PDF documents, retrieve contextually relevant answers using LLMs, and manage data efficiently. The system integrates authentication APIs, a vector database (Pinecone) for document embedding storage, and a MySQL database for secure PDF.
